### **Objective**

The owner of the Store wants us to create an interactive dashboard to track and analyze their online sales.

### **KPIs**

1. Total Revenue of the store.

2. What are the best selling SKU items? by color? by size?

3. What is the average order value?

4. What are the peak days or time periods with the highest sales? 

### **Process**

1. Created an interactive dashboard to track and analyze online sales data.

2. Used complex parameters to drill down in worksheets and customization using filters and slicers.

3. Created connections, join new tables, and calculations to manipulate data and enable user-driven parameters for visualizations.

4. Used different types of customized visualization (bar chart, clustered bar chart,line chart, slicers, etc).

## **Project Insight**

1. The store generates the maximum sells on Saturday, Sunday, Monday.

2. The store generates the maximum sells from XL and 2XL SKUS.

3. The store generates the maximum sells from Dark Blue	SKUs.


## **Final Conclusion**

1. The store generates the maximum sells on Saturday, Sunday, Monday. To improve sales of the E-Commerce Store, the owner must show maximum ads, sale offers/coupons in before these days. Typically Thursday and Friday.
2. The store generates the maximum sells from XL and 2XL SKUS and Dark Blue	SKUs. To avoid the running out of stock, we should restock the same before/at fridays in the inventory.
